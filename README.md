# messenger-chatbot
This is a simple implementation for Facebook Messenger Chat-bot.

**Parrot** is  a simple chatbot structure built for _facebook messenger_ using Javascript.

The basic aim for parrot is to learn on how to implement a chatbot with features like:
- Facebook Cards
- Smart reply
- NLP
- Instagram and Twitter Integration
etc 

a live example of the bot has been implemented on the page [here](https://www.facebook.com/sinusoid17) using [Chatfuel](https://chatfuel.com/)

The code is a replica of what has been implemented with the page given above and can be utilised for learning purposes.


This parrot messenger bot has the following requirements and dependencies:
- Node.js
- npm
- Heroku
- Git
- Code Editor (I have used **Visual Studio Code** for obvious reasons :P)

**For Refernce** you can visit - ![Build Guid for FB Chatbots](parrot/files/How-to-Make-a-FB-Messenger-Chatbot.pdf)


**Build process and dependencies will be updated soon**
